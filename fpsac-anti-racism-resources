I am having trouble hearing but I wanted to make sure everyone was aware of this program:

So that they can encourage their students to apply in future years. 
Perhaps more programs like this at the undergraduate level (and programs like EDGE) would be helpful?

I need to get a call

From Bianca Viray:  I am currently watching a talk about a former UW graduate Gloria Hewitt, the seventh Africa American woman to earn her PhD (1962), and thought others might be interested!

It is currently livestreaming  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXtBlW-XoM4  and I think the recording will be available at the same link when the talk is complete.
